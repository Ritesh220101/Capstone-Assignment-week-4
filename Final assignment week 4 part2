Part2
I will be using the data of newyork city crime rate. In which I will try to find out the crime rate of each locality in which a particular or new person and his family can live happily. 
By using foursquare location data I can find the crime rate in each localhood.By which I can categorise the houses or areas by more crime rates and low crime rates. After that by analysing and modelling we can get an ideal house in loacalhood without or less crime rate.
